split_nlogo_experiment installation instructions
================================================

Using setup.py
--------------

The easiest way to install is to run the setup.py script as::

   python setup.py install

This may require super user privileges (so you may have to put a sudo in front, or run it as root). You can also install it in your own home directory by using the --user switch::

   python setup.py install --user

The above will cause split_nlogo_experiment to be installed in your home directory (on un*x/Linux systems in ~/.local/bin by default). If you go for this option you may need to edit your $PATH variable.

Run python setup.py --help for many more options regarding the setup.py script.

By hand
-------

If you for some reason don't want to use the setup.py script you can just copy split_nlogo_experiment.py (or scripts/split_nlogo_experiment if you have a distribution - it's just a copy of the first file) to any location of your own choice or even run it from the directory directly. It's just a single file. 

If needed: you can edit the file and replace #!python by #! followed by whatever the path to your python distribution is. You could also change the file permissions to executable if you want to be able to call it like a script.
