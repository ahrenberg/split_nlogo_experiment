About
-----

This script was written to ease the burden of running Netlogo  <http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/> simulations on computing grids.
It parses an .nlogo file, looking for the <experiments> XML setup, and then constructs unique set-up files for each variable value combination in the experiment. Each of these files represent a single simulation and can be run in parallel on a computing cluster using netlogo-headless with the --setup-file switch.

In addition split_nlogo_experiment has basic templating functionality that can be used to automatically build queuing/execution-scripts.


Requirements and testing
------------------------

split_nlogo_experiment requires Python <www.python.org> and has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.2, other Python3 versions should work as well, and perhaps also Python 2.6 (though this has not been tested).

The generated XML files was tested with BehaviorSpace in Netlogo 4.1.3 and 5.0RC7 .


Brief manual
------------

For a full list of options run:: 

    split_nlogo_experiment -h


Basic usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

To split an experiment called 'experiment' in the file model.nlogo use::

   split_nlogo_experiment model.nlogo experiment

This will produce a set of files called experiment<XYZ>.xml where <XYZ> is a zero-padded number. Each XML file represents a unique variable value combination as an experiment. These files can be used with the netlogo switch --setup-file, e.g::

   netlogo-headless.sh --model model.nlogo --setup-file experiment0.xml

To run the first value combination.

The XML files are always given the name of the experiment plus a sequence number. If you want to prefix the file name for some reason you can use the --output_prefix option when calling split_nlogo_experiment. If you want the XML files output in some other directory than the current use the --output_dir option. For instance::

   split_nlogo_experiment --output_dir /tmp --output_prefix my_ model.nlogo experiment

will cause the XML files to be saved in the directory /tmp and be named my_experiment<XYZ>.xml where <XYZ> is, as before, a number from 0 up to N-1. N being the number of possible variable value combinations.

Note that all the output directory must exist and be writable. If not an error is produced and the program exits.

How many XML files are generated?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Short answer: as many as you have unique combinations of variable values in your BehaviorSpace times the number of repetitions you decide to 'break out' using the --repetitions_per_run switch. 

For example if you have two variables a, and b, and you have configured your BehaviorSpace so that [a 1 2 3] and [b 4 5], That is, there are three possible values for a (1, 2, or 3), and two for b (4 or 5). There are six combinations of individual values for a, and b. (a=1, b=4) (a=1, b=5), (a=2, b=4), et c. split_nlogo_experiment will construct one XML file for each of these combinations and number then from 0 to 5.

Further, assume that you have set the number of repetitions in your BehaviorSpace experiment to be 10. By default split_nlogo_experiment will preserve this so that you end up with 6 unique files, each creating a run repeating 10 times. However if you had invoked split_nlogo_experiment with the switch '--repetitions_per_run 2', you would end up with 30 files (6 variable combinations, each copied  5 times) set up to run the experiment 2 times each. Likewise using '--repetitions_per_run 5' would create 12 files, each repeating the run 5 times.

Start script templating functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computing clusters usually have a queuing mechanism where some command script is run in order to commit a job. If the BehaviorSpace experiment result in a large number of simulations this can be a very tedious process if one needs an individual script for each simulation. 

split_nlogo_experiment has a very basic templating mechanism that may be used to produce an additional file with each simulation XML file. The option --create_script takes a file name as parameter. This file is read and a specialized version having key names replaced with current values are saved for each XML file. Allowed keys are

{job}
   Name of the job. Will be the name of the xml-file (minus extension).

{combination}
   The value of the parameter combination_nr.
       
{experiment}
   The value of the parameter experiment.
       
{csv}
   File name, including full path, of a experiment-unique csv-file.

{setup}
   The value of the parameter csvfile.

{model}
   The value of the parameter nlogofile.

{csvfname}
   Only the file name part of the {csv} key.
   
{csvfpath}
   Only the path part of the {csv} key.

As an example consider constructing a PBS script for each experiment. This script will issue special PBS commands creating log files, setting the job name, and finally run netlogo-headless with the right commands. To do this create a template file looking like::

   #!/bin/bash
   #PBS -N {job}
   #PBS -o /tmp/{job}.log
   #PBS -e /tmp/{job}_error.log
   netlogo-headless.sh --model {model} --setup-file {setup} --table {csv}

Assume this file is called template.pbs, then calling the split_nlogo_experiment as::

      split_nlogo_experiment --create_script template.pbs model.nlogo experiment

will, in addition to creating the experiment<XYZ>.xml files also create files called experiment_script<XYZ>.pbs (file ending will always be the same as for the template file). In these files the keys {job} will be replaced by experiment<XYZ>, {model} by the absolute path name to model.nlogo, {setup} by the absolute path name to experiment<XYZ>.xml, and {csv} by the absolute path name to the suggested CSV output file name.

split_nlogo_experiment looks up the absolute path to any file and directory given and use this for the keys. The reason for doing so is that the netlogo-headless.sh script make the simulation always run in the netlogo directory. This has the side effect that relative paths will not work. As a work around the script translates all paths to absolute paths. If you want to suppress this behavior and always use the file names and paths as given when calling split_nlogo_experiment use the --no_path_translation switch.

The problem
~~~~~~~~~~~

When constructing simulations it is often desirable to run them with a range of different parameter values in order to investigate each parameter's impact on the overall process. In Netlogo such runs are easily configured using the Behavioral space editor where variables can be assigns arbitrary value ranges. Each possible value of variable values result in an unique simulation run however, and for scientific experiments the number of runs can easily grow huge. Netlogo can run these simulations in parallel threads, but does currently not have native support to distribute them over a grid of computers. This must be done by hand. Neither is there functionality to generate individual set-up files from the BehaviorSpace editor.

split_nlogo_experiment was written to do just that.


Technicalities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

split_nlogo_experiment searches the experiment XML description for enumeratedValueSet tags with more than one value as well as steppedValueSet tags. The XML of these nodes are parsed, and the values for the associated variable stored. Following this, one new experiment for every possible variable-value combination is built where the multi-valued tags have been replaced by enumeratedValueSet tags carrying a single possible value. These are saved to XML files.

Please note that as the program constructs all possible combinations of variable values it is necessary to expand the value sets in the original experiment. (Value sets are the variables you give on a [start step stop] form.) There is a general problem with rounding errors programming such functions in any language, and this leads to a somewhat different behavior for integers and floating point value sets in netlogo experiments. For an example try the ranges [0 2 12] and [0 0.2 1.2] for some variable in the BehaviorSpace editor of netlogo 4.1.3. The former range will give you 7 runs, while the latter only yields 6. I have made an effort to mimic this behavior when I expand the value sets and build experiments. As it is two different implementations and two different programming languages however, there could be cases when you do not get the number of runs netlogo tells you. If so, please let me know about it.
